# Veni Vici

Submitted by: Miracle Adeoye

Veni Vici is a web app that allows users to discover new and interesting cat breeds. By fetching data from a Cat API, users can view different cats and their attributes, and influence their discovery experience by adding attributes to a ban list, which filters out future results.

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**

- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Centering the web app content and ensuring proper responsiveness were some of the challenges encountered while building the app. Adjusting the API call to handle user bans and correctly displaying the background image were also tackled.
